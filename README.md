## 💰 Personal Expense Tracker in Python

### 📝 **Description:**
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that allows users to **track their daily expenses**. It stores expense records in a **CSV file** so the data is retained even after the program ends. Users can **add expenses**, **view their expense history**, and **see the total amount spent** — all from a simple terminal menu.

It uses:
- Basic Python syntax
- File handling
- The `csv` module
- Conditional logic and loops

---

### ✅ **Features Implemented:**
1. **Add Expense:**
   - User inputs an amount and a category (e.g., food, transport).
   - The data is saved into a CSV file (`expenses.csv`).

2. **View Expenses:**
   - Displays all the recorded expenses in a readable format.

3. **Total Spent:**
   - Calculates and displays the total amount spent.

4. **Persistent Storage:**
   - All expenses are saved in a `.csv` file so they’re not lost when the program ends.

5. **User-friendly Menu:**
   - Simple number-based input system for ease of use.
